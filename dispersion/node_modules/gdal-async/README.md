# node-gdal-async

**Update: since Oct 24 I am homeless and living in my van. I lost access to most of my computer hardware. The eviction from my home has been timed for maximum effect as I was not present when it happened. I have only a single set of clothes and no means to get anything else. Please, if you use my software, consider asking everyone in the geospatial community if they are taking part in this extortion and why.**

## Long term support of this project

The birth of this project is related to a huge extortion in the geography community linked to a sexual harassment affair, linked to a penis-size problem, and covered up with corruption in the French Judiciary. It is maintained as a free service to the geography community so that it can remain as a constant remainder to [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/) - who chose to back the extortion. I have been working on it while living on social welfare. You can safely use this framework in your projects, be assured that it will be maintained very well and for many years to come. Even if lately, this project has had a number of issues declared in a way as to make evident that my users support the extortion, I remain fully committed to maintaining it.

It's companion project on the client-side is [`rlayers`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/rlayers).


## Installation

Pre-built binaries are provided for most recent Linux distributions, Windows 64 bit and OS X 10.15:

```sh
npm install gdal-async
```

### Linking with your own version of GDAL

By default all dependencies are the latest versions and bundled out of the box, but if you would like to link against a custom GDAL library you will have to rebuild it when installing using the following flags:

```sh
# --shared_gdal allows linking to the OS-provided libgdal, requires libgdal-dev
# (debian: sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev)
$ npm install gdal-async --build-from-source --shared_gdal
```

If you have multiple versions of GDAL or your library is not in its standard location, you can use the usual `CXXFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` variables:
```sh
$ CXXFLAGS="-I/some/path/include" LDFLAGS="-L/some/path/lib" npm install gdal-async --build-from-source --shared_gdal
```

## Sample usage

### Synchronous

#### Raster

```js
const gdal = require("gdal-async")
const dataset = gdal.open("sample.tif")

console.log("number of bands: " + dataset.bands.count())
console.log("width: " + dataset.rasterSize.x)
console.log("height: " + dataset.rasterSize.y)
console.log("geotransform: " + dataset.geoTransform)
console.log("srs: " + (dataset.srs ? dataset.srs.toWKT() : 'null'))
```

#### Vector

```js
const gdal = require("gdal-async")
const dataset = gdal.open("sample.shp")
const layer = dataset.layers.get(0)

console.log("number of features: " + layer.features.count())
console.log("fields: " + layer.fields.getNames())
console.log("extent: " + JSON.stringify(layer.extent))
console.log("srs: " + (layer.srs ? layer.srs.toWKT() : 'null'))
```

### Asynchronous

Mixing of synchronous and asynchronous operations is supported.

#### Mixing of synchronous and asynchronous operations

Simultaneous operations on distinct dataset objects are always safe and can run it parallel.

Simultaneous operations on the same dataset object are safe too but they won't run in parallel. This is a limitation of GDAL. The only way to have multiple parallel operations on the same file is to use multiple dataset objects. Keep in mind that Node.js/libuv won't be able to detect which async contexts are waiting on each other, so if you launch 16 simultaneous operations on 4 different datasets, there is always a chance that libuv will pick 4 operations on the same dataset to run - which will take all 4 slots on the thread pool. It is recommended to either increase `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` or to make sure that every dataset has exactly one operation running at any given time. Take a look at `ASYNCIO.md` which explains this in detail.

Also be particularly careful when mixing synchronous and asynchronous operations in server code. If a GDAL operation is running in the background for any given Dataset, all synchronous operations on that same Dataset on the main thread will block the event loop until the background operation is finished. **This includes synchronous getters and setters that might otherwise be instantaneous.**. It is recommended to retrieve all values such as raster size or no data value or spatial reference **before** starting any I/O operations or use the new asynchronous getters available in 3.3.2 and later.

**Does not support `worker_threads` yet**

**The HDF5 driver is not thread safe on Windows**

#### With callbacks

If the last argument of an `xxxAsync` function is a callback,
it will be called on completion with standard *(e,r)* semantics

In this case the function will return a resolved *Promise*
```js
const gdal = require('gdal-async');
gdal.openAsync('sample.tif', (e, dataset) => {
        if (e) {
            console.error(e);
            return;
        }
        dataset.bands.get(1).pixels.readAsync(0, 0, dataset.rasterSize.x,
        dataset.rasterSize.y, (e, data) => {
            if (e) {
                console.error(e);
                return;
            }
            console.log(data);
        });
});
```

#### With promises

If there is no callback, the function will return a *Promise*

```js
const gdal = require('gdal-async')
gdal.openAsync('sample.tif')
    .then((dataset) => dataset.bands.getAsync(1))
    .then((band) => band.pixels.readAsync(0, 0, band.ds.rasterSize.x, band.ds.rasterSize.y))
    .then((data) => console.log(data))
    .catch((e) => console.error(e))
```

### With async/await

```js
const gdal = require('gdal-async');
try {
    const ds = await gdal.openAsync('sample.tif');
    const band = await ds.bands.getAsync(1);
    const rasterSize = await ds.rasterSizeAsync;    // starting with 3.3.2
    const data = await band.pixels.readAsync(0, 0, rasterSize.x, rasterSize.y);
} catch (e => console.error(e));
```

### TypeScript (starting from 3.1)

TypeScript support is available beginning with `gdal-async@3.1.0`
```ts
import * as gdal from 'gdal-async'
// Alternatively and only with esModuleInterop = true in tsconfig.json
// import gdal from 'gdal-async'

const ds1: gdal.Dataset = gdal.open('sample.tif')
const ds2: Promise<gdal.Dataset> = gdal.openAsync('sample.tif')
```
In TypeScript `gdal` is a collection of named exports - as this is the preferred way of importing a native module in TypeScript and it does not impose the use of the `esModuleInterop` flag.

If your project already has `esModuleInterop`, you can import it with the default import.

#### About type generation

The TypeScript declaration file (index.d.ts) is auto-generated by the yatag tool as the last step of the native build. If you add or modify C++ APIs and rebuild the project, the types will be regenerated accordingly.

- Manual generation: you can run `npm run yatag` to regenerate `lib/index.d.ts` without a full rebuild.
- During build: the binding.gyp includes an action that runs yatag after compiling the native module on all platforms.
- Config: see `yatag.config.js` for included sources and output path.

### MJS (Node.js ES6 modules)

When importing from a so-called Michael Jackson Script environment (Node.js native ES6 modules), the correct import syntax is:
```js
import gdal from 'gdal-async'
```
In MJS `gdal` is a default export - as this allows for maximum compatibility with existing CJS applications.

### Built-in networking (starting from 3.2)

Built-in networking uses an embedded version of `libcurl`. It supports `zlib` compression through Node.js' own `zlib` support. It does not support `brotli` or `zstd`. Node.js includes `brotli`, but as of Node.js 16 it still does not export these symbols for use by add-ons (yes, go bug them - ask them for c-ares too).
SSL on Linux uses OpenSSL through Node.js' own support. It uses the curl trusted root CA store by default and another store can be provided through the `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable or GDAL config option. SSL on Windows and OSX uses the OS-provided mechanisms - Schannel and SecureTransport respectively - and thus the trusted root CA store will be the one provided by the OS.

### Breaking changes relative to node-gdal / node-gdal-next

 * If you are coming from `node-gdal-next`
    - Starting with 3.2
        * `gdal.Geometry.fromGeoJson` now throws an `Error` on error instead of returning a null geometry
    - Starting with 3.3
        * Drop support for linking against a shared GDAL 1.x library
        * Drop support for Node.js 10.x and 15.x
        * Linux uses lazy-binding meaning that parts of the binary won't be loaded in memory until the first function call
        * `gdal.DatasetBands.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid band is requested instead of returning a null object
        * `gdal.DatasetLayers.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid layer is requested instead of returning a null object
        * `gdal.FeatureDefnFields.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid field definition is requested instead of returning a null object
        * `gdal.FeatureFields.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid field is requested instead of returning a null object
          - it can still return `null` if the field exists in the definition but it is not set in the feature
        * `gdal.GDALDrivers.get()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid driver is requested instead of returning a null object
        * `gdal.GeometryCollectionChildren.get()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid sub-geometry is requested instead of returning a null object
        * `gdal.LayerFeatures.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid feature is requested instead of returning a null object
        * `gdal.LayerFields.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid field is requested instead of returning a null object
        * `gdal.LineStringPoints.get()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid point is requested instead of returning a null object
        * `gdal.PolygonRings.get()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid ring is requested instead of returning a null object
        * All `gdal.Geometry` methods that return a `gdal.Geometry` throw an `Error` on error instead of returning a null object
    - Starting with 3.4
        * GDAL >= 2.1 is required
        * All platforms use lazy-binding meaning that parts of the binary won't be loaded in memory until the first function call
        * `gdal.RasterBand.noDataValue` now returns `NaN` if the original value was `NaN` instead of null; when setting it to `null` it correctly clears the `NoDataValue` instead of setting it to `NaN`; one should still exercise care when using `NaN` as a `NoDataValue` - since even if the binary representation is defined by IEEE 754, different formats, compilers or architectures may exhibit different behavior
        * TypeScript bindings now internally use `strict: true` mode with many getters and functions receiving an additional explicit `null` return type, consider using `strictNullChecks: false` in your `tsconfig.json` if you need to suppress these new errors in existing code

 * If you are coming from `node-gdal`, in addition to all of the above
    - With PROJ 6+, the order of coordinates for EPSG geographic coordinate reference systems is latitude first,
    longitude second. If you don't want to make large code changes, you can replace code like `gdal.SpatialReference.fromEPSG(4326)` with `gdal.SpatialReference.fromProj4('+init=epsg:4326')`

### With `ndarray` from `scijs`

A separate plugin [ndarray-gdal](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ndarray-gdal) allows zero-copy I/O, with GDAL-backed interleaving in C++ using SIMD instructions, for all possible strides both for 2D raster data and N-dimensional `MDArray` data. The plugin requires at least `gdal-async@3.3`.

### With `ExprTk.js`

A separate plugin [gdal-exprtk](https://github.com/mmomtchev/gdal-exprtk) adds seamless integration with [ExprTk.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ExprTk.js) allowing for truly multi-threaded and asynchronous computing with raster datasets. The plugin requires at least `gdal-async@3.5`.

### Pruning the source tree

A special NPM script target, `npm run prune` allows to delete most of the bundled source packages - these are not needed unless rebuilding from source. It significantly reduces the overall size of this module.

### Using in Amazon Linux Lambdas

Amazon Linux was supported starting from `gdal-async@3.3.4`. There is no shared GDAL support, only the bundled GDAL version is supported. It is highly recommended that you prune the module before deploying to an Amazon Lambda - when pruned the module is only 16MB zipped. Starting from `gdal-async@3.6.0` only Amazon 2022 will be supported.

### Using with Electron

Refer to the provided example in `examples/electron`. Prepare for some very rough edge on Windows due to [#29893](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/29893). Also `https` is not supported when running in Electron.

### Bundling with `rollup`

If you are bundling your application for production deployment, `gdal-async` can be bundled with `rollup` through `rollup-plugin-natives` since [`rollup-plugin-natives#13`](https://github.com/danielgindi/rollup-plugin-natives/pull/13). Here is a an example configuration:

```js
plugins: [
  native({
    copyTo: 'build/prod/lib',
    destDir: './lib'
  }),
  copy({
    targets: [
      {
        src: 'node_modules/gdal-async/deps/libgdal/gdal/data',
        dest: 'build/deps/libgdal/gdal'
      },
      {
        src: 'node_modules/gdal-async/deps/libproj/proj/data',
        dest: 'build/deps/libproj/proj'
      }
    ]
  })
]
```

You can check [XC-DB](https://github.com/mmomtchev/xc-db) for a working project that uses `gdal-async` with `Express` and is bundled for production with `rollup`.

### Bundling with `Next.js`

As `gdal-async` is a Node.js native module, it does not work in client side components which run in the client browser. You can however use it in server side components, if you can ensure that this code will never get called on the client side.

Add this to your `next.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */

export default {
  webpack: (config) => {
    const externals = ['gdal-async'];
    if (config.externals)
      config.externals.push(...externals);
    else
      config.externals = externals;
    return config;
  }
};
```

## Known issues

* [#2](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async/issues/2) When running multiple parallel async operations per `Dataset` and on multiple `Dataset`s, thread starvation is possible as explained in [`ASYNCIO.md`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async/blob/master/ASYNCIO.md)
* [#11](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async/issues/11) Accessing a closed `Dataset` object results in a warning with a stack trace printed out to stdout
* [#17](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async/issues/17) HDF5 on Windows is not thread-safe
* [#28](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async/issues/28) `gdal-async` is not compatible with Electron >= 16.0.0 on Windows

## Bundled Drivers
